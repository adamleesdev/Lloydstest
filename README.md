App to display cat facts and images from the suggested api list.

Using Java, MVVM architecture, basic integral libraries to make/parse network calls and display images.

I have used as many libraries as necessary to have the application perform its tasks efficiently with an effort to keep logic and presentation as concise as possible. 

It didnt seem that UI, design or interaction was a part of the specification so has been kept plain and simple.


Given more time there could be support added for;
Orientation changes with some state management 
Better UI support for varying screen sizes
Testing
